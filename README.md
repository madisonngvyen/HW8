# Hardware 8 - Interrupts and Button Bounce (CPE233)
This project explores microcontroller interrupts and the challenge of button bounce using the OTTER MCU architecture. The goal is to understand, implement, and test interrupt handling and debouncing mechanisms in hardware. 

## Goal / Objective
- Understanding how microcontroller interrupts work, including their connection to the OTTER MCU.
- Implement the interrupt architecture on the OTTER hardware.
- Write and test Interrupt Service Routines for efficient handling.
- Learn about switch bounce and apply debouncing techniques for external inputs. 

## Tools and Requirements
- Vivado (synthesis and simulation)
- RARS (assembly testing)
- Basys FPGA Board (Hardware testing)
